        <p class="column">Famous for its cultural attractions and charming hospitality, Dublin has always been one of
          the most popular
          cities in Europe to visit. But nowadays, in addition to its centuries-old traditions and historic roots,
          Dublin
          has grown into its own as one of the top cosmopolitan cities of Europe.</p>
        <p class="column">The ancient capital of the Emerald Isle, Dublin has been written about for centuries. The
          River Liffey, which
          flows into the harbor, has been vital to life and civilization here from the beginning. Today it's one of the
          city's focal points, slicing Dublin in two and creating one of the busiest commercial hubs in the country.</p>
        <p class="column">Dublin's history goes way back. Pre-independence from Britain, Dublin was once the second city
          of the British
          Empire. You can find evidence of English influence all over the city, from the Georgian architecture to
          picturesque parks. You'll also find the relics of the country's violent struggles for independence, and
          monuments
          that serve as reminders of how hard the Irish fought for freedom over hundreds of years.</p>
        <p class="column">A cultural capital, Dublin has given the world renowned literary figures such as Beckett,
          Joyce, Shaw, and Wilde. It was dubbed a UNESCO City of Literature in 2010, but Dublin's written traditions
          stretch back to as early as 800CE with The Book of Kells, now on permanent exhibition at Trinity College.</p>
